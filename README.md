# sql-lab3
Lab 3 for CSC 184 Mobile app programming class where we practiced using SQL for a given csv data file

This lab used postgreSQL to create strctures for the 4 required tables. I created a dummy table to load in the entire csv file given, then the desired data were copied over to the designated tables. Then, various tasks that involves basic SQL operations were required for this lab:  

Returns highest closing price;  
Returns date with lowest volume;  
Update 12/15/16 volume to 1;  
Delete data for date 3/19/18;  
Give final count (rows) for date in 3 tables;

These demonstrations can be found in the demo folder in the form of screenshots.
